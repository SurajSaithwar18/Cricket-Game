# Cricket-Game
Here I have created a simple cricket game mini project using random module in python programming language.

What I have done:
1. Ask user the no of ball to play.
2. A list containing digits from 0 to 10
3. Empty list to store randomly choosen no.
4. No of Wickets (User Choice), No of Runs (0) and No of Wickets fall(0) are initialize
5. For loop to iterate till the no of ball to choose random digits from the list containing digits
6.  Inside the loop ramdomly choosen numbers are appended to the empty list created.
7.  Again a for loop is creatde to iterate through the list of randomly choosen number.
8.  Inside the loop we checked whether No of Wickets falls is below or equal to the No of wickets or not.
9.  If yes, then
10.  We use condition to check Runs or wickets by comparing choice with digits (0-9)
11.  If: Choice = 1: One Run
12.  Choice = 2: Two Run
13.  Choice = 3: Three Run
14.  Choice = 4: Four Run
15.  Choice = 5: Run out or Stumping
16.  Choice = 6: Six Run
15.  Choice = 7: Bowled Out
16.  Choice = 8: Caught Out
17.  Choice = 9: LBW
18.   And equivalent Runs and Wickets are update to No of Runs and No of Wickets fall
19.   Outside the loop Total Runs score and Wicket Falls are printed
